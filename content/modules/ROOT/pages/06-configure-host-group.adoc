== Introduction

Red Hat Satellite provides several logical units for grouping hosts.
Hosts that are members of those groups inherit the group configuration.
It is recommended to configure the majority of settings at the host
group level instead of defining hosts directly. Configuring a new host
then largely becomes a matter of adding it to the right host group. As
host groups can be nested, you can create a structure that best fits
your requirements.

For more information on Host Groups, please see the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.15/html/overview_concepts_and_deployment_considerations/chap-architecture_guide-host_grouping_concepts[documentation].

Weâ€™ll create a host group that applies a Red Hat Enterprise Linux System
Role to configure the firewall to allow incoming connections through
port 80/tcp.

== Create a host group

Navigate to the `+Configure+` and `+Host Groups+` menu.

.host groups menu

In the host group menu do the following:

[arabic]
. Name the host group `+Application Servers+`.
. Select `+satellite.lab+` as the content source.
. Select the `+Test+` lifecycle environment.
. Select the `+RHEL9+` content view.
. Click on `+Ansible Roles+`

We need to tell the firewall system role to allow incoming connections
to port 80/tcp. In the Parameters menu do the following:

[arabic]
. Click `+Add Parameter+`.
. Name the parameter `+firewall+`. > [!WARNING] > Parameter names are
case sensitive. `+firewall+` must be in lower case.
. Choose the type `+array+`.
. Copy and paste the following into the `+value+` field.

{empty}[!NOTE] `+Host Group Parameters+` are variables that can be
applied by RHEL System Roles or Ansible Roles. You can find a list of
available variables by clicking on Configure > Ansible > Variables.
`+Host Group Parameters+` can help you configure subsets of hosts using
RHEL System Roles with different variables, according to your
requirements. image:../assets/variables.png[variables]

We will assign the `+RHEL9+` activation key to this group.

[arabic]
. Under `+Activation Keys+` enter `+RHEL9+`.
. Click on `+Submit+`.
