== Configure a Host Group

Red Hat Satellite provides several logical units for grouping hosts.
Hosts that are members of those groups inherit the group configuration.
It is recommended to configure the majority of settings at the host
group level instead of defining hosts directly. Configuring a new host
then largely becomes a matter of adding it to the right host group. As
host groups can be nested, you can create a structure that best fits
your requirements.

For more information on Host Groups, please see the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.15/html/overview_concepts_and_deployment_considerations/chap-architecture_guide-host_grouping_concepts[documentation].

Weâ€™ll create a host group that applies a Red Hat Enterprise Linux System
Role to configure the firewall to allow incoming connections through
port 80/tcp.
