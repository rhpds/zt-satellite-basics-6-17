== Create an Activation Key

Activation keys provide a method to automate system registration and
subscription attachment. You can create multiple keys and associate them
with different environments and Content Views. For example, you might
create a basic activation key with a subscription for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux workstations and associate it with Content Views from a particular
environment.

You can use activation keys during content host registration to improve
the speed, simplicity and consistency of the process. Note that
activation keys are used only when hosts are registered. If changes are
made to an activation key, it is applicable only to hosts that are
registered with the amended activation key in the future. The changes
are not made to existing hosts.

If you click on `+Repository Sets+`, you’ll notice that this Activation
Key provides access to the RHEL 10 AppStream and BaseOS repositories. The `Status` of these two repositories shows as `Enabled`.
This access is provided by configuring the Activation Key to use the
`+RHEL10+` Content View.
