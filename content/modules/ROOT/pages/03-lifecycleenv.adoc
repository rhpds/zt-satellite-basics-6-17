== Introduction

The application life cycle is a concept central to Red Hat Satellite 6’s
content management functions. The application life cycle defines how a
particular system and its software look at a particular stage. For
example, an application life cycle might be simple; you might only have
a development stage and production stage. In this case the application
life cycle might look like this:

* Development
* Production

However, a more complex application life cycle might have further
stages, such as a phase for testing or a beta release. This adds extra
stages to the application life cycle:

* Development
* Testing
* Beta Release
* Production
