== Apply RHEL System Role

IMPORTANT: Before starting this challenge, make sure that your hosts
have finished rebooting from the previous challenge. You can easily
check by clicking on the terminal tab to check that you have a working
session with each host.

Earlier, we configured the our host group to have a system role applied
to it. Specifically, port 80/tcp was to be opened. You can find out more
about https://access.redhat.com/articles/3050101[RHEL System Roles
