== Introduction

A powerful feature of Content Views in Red Hat Satellite is the ability
to filter content. This means that you can include or exclude content
from being installed by your hosts. In this challenge, we’ll block the
installation of emacs with a filter (since it’s bloatware).

Go to the Content Views menu.

.cv

Click on the `+RHEL9+` content view.

Do the following.

[arabic]
. Click on the `+Filters+` tab.
. Click `+Create filter+`.

.filter

Create a filter with the following steps.

[arabic]
. Name the filter `+emacs+`.
. Select `+Exclude filter+`.
. Give the filter a description. We’re going to exclude emacs from being
included in the `+RHEL9+` content view.
. Click `+Create filter+`.

Next, click `+Add RPM rule+`.

.emacs

Configure your RPM rule in the following way.

[arabic]
. Since we’re filtering `+emacs+`, enter `+emacs+`.
. Select `+All versions+`.
. Click `+Add rule+`.

Click `+Publish new version+` to publish a new version of the `+RHEL9+`
content view containing our new `+emacs+` filter.

.filter pub

The new content view will make `+emacs+` unavailable for hosts to
install.

[arabic]
. Add a description to the content view version. In this case,
`+added emacs filter+`.
. Select `+Promote+`.
. Select the `+Test+` lifecycle environment.
. Click `+Next+`.

.publish

Ensure the details of this new version are correct and then click
`+Finish+`. Make sure to wait for the content view to finish publishing
or else the filter won’t work properly.

[!WARNING] It can take up to 5 minutes for this particular task to
complete publishing the content view.
