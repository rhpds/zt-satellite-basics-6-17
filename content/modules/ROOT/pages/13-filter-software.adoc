== Filter content

A powerful feature of Content Views in Red Hat Satellite is the ability
to filter content. This means that you can include or exclude content
from being installed by your hosts. In this challenge, we’ll block the
installation of emacs with a filter (since it’s bloatware).

Create a filter with the following steps.

included in the `+RHEL9+` content view.
. Click `+Create filter+`.

Configure your RPM rule in the following way.

[arabic]

. Select `+All versions+`.
. Click `+Add rule+`.

Click `+Publish new version+` to publish a new version of the `+RHEL9+`
content view containing our new `+emacs+` filter.

.Publish a new version of the content view containing the new filter

The new content view will make `+emacs+` unavailable for hosts to
install.

[arabic]
. Add a description to the content view version. In this case,
`+added emacs filter+`.
. Select `+Promote+`.
. Select the `+Test+` lifecycle environment.
. Click `+Next+`.

.Publish the content view filter

Ensure the details of this new version are correct and then click
`+Finish+`. Make sure to wait for the content view to finish publishing
or else the filter won’t work properly.

WARNING: It can take up to 5 minutes for this particular task to
complete publishing the content view.

Next, click on either `rhel1.lab terminal` or `rhel2.lab terminal` and run the following command.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install -y emacs

.Emacs is blocked. lol

Now all your users will be forced to use vim.
