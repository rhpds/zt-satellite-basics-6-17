== Create a Content View

In this challenge we’ll create a Content View. Red Hat Satellite uses
Content Views to create customized subsets of repositories from the full
repositories synchronized to the Red Hat Satellite server. You can use
Content Views to define which software versions a particular environment
uses. For example, a Production environment might use a Content View
containing older package versions, while a Development environment might
use a Content View containing newer package versions.

Since this is a basic introduction to Satellite, we will only create a
Content View for the purpose of providing content to RHEL hosts, without
regard for Test, Production lifecycle use cases.

To learn more about Content Views and how to use them to manage content
for different lifecycle environments, please see
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.15/html/managing_content/managing_content_views_content-management[Managing
Content Views] in Satellite documentation.
