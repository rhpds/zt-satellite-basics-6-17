== Enable the Tracer service on RHEL hosts

Often when software is updated, services on a host must be restarted
before the new software can run. The tracer utility can detect when a
service needs to be restarted, and notify you through Red Hat Satellite.

To demonstrate this capability, we’ll install the
`+katello-host-tools-tracer+` package on our hosts through remote
execution. We’ll perform the following tasks:

[arabic]
. Synchronize the `+Satellite client 6+` repository to our Satellite
server.
. Make the repository available to our hosts by adding it to our
`+RHEL9+` content view.
. Install `+katello-host-tools-tracer+` on our hosts.

Go to `+Content+` and click on `+Red Hat Repositories+`.

Next add the `+satellite-client-6-for-rhel-10+` repository.

== Add the Satellite client repository to the RHEL10 content view

Now that the repository containing the Tracer application is
synchronized to Satellite, we’ll make it available to our hosts by
adding and enabling the repository in our existing `+RHEL10+` content
view.

=====
.Add the Satellite client repository to the RHEL10 content view

Navigate to `+Content Views+`.

.Content views menu

Click on the `+Repositories+` tab.

.Repositories tab

Select `+All+` from the `+Status+` dropdown to unhide the Satellite
tools repository.

.View all available repositories
image::selectallcv.png[unhide]

Add the repo.

[arabic]
. Select the repo `+Red Hat Satellite Client 6 for RHEL 10 x86_64 RPMs+`.
. Click `+Add repositories+`.

.Add the Satellite Client repository
image::addclientrepo.png[add repos]

Click `+Publish new version+`.

.Publish a new version of the content view
image::publishnewversion.png[]

We’ll now publish a new version of the content view.

[arabic]
. Add a description to the new version of the content view. In this
example we added `+Added the Satellite Client 6 repo.+`.
. Click `+Promote+`.
. Click on the `+Test+` lifecycle environment.
. Click `+Next+`.

.Publish content view wizard

Click `+Finish+`.

== Enable access to the Satellite client repository

Now we’ll enable access to the
`+Red Hat Satellite Client 6 for RHEL 10 x86_64 RPMs+` repo by specifying
it in the `+Activation Key+`. When new hosts are added, they will
automatically receive access to the enabled repository so that Tracer
can be installed.

With existing hosts, there is one extra step to enable access to the tracer app which we’ll cover in the step after this.

. Select the `+Red Hat Satellite Client 6 for RHEL 10 x86_64 RPMs+`
repository.
. Click `+Override to Enabled+`.

== Install Tracer on existing hosts managed by Satellite

Here’s the extra step we’ll need to perform to enable access to the
Tracer app for our existing hosts. New hosts added after this step will
automatically get access.

Tracer is now installed. We’ll see how it will help us in the next
challenge, where we apply errata updates.
