Often when software is updated, services on a host must be restarted
before the new software can run. The tracer utility can detect when a
service needs to be restarted, and notify you through Red Hat Satellite.

To demonstrate this capability, we’ll install the
`+katello-host-tools-tracer+` package on our hosts through remote
execution. We’ll perform the following tasks:

[arabic]
. Synchronize the `+Satellite client 6+` repository to our Satellite
server.
. Make the repository available to our hosts by adding it to our
`+RHEL9+` content view.
. Install `+katello-host-tools-tracer+` on our hosts.

== Add the Satellite client repository

Go to `+Content+` and click on `+Red Hat Repositories+`.

.rh repos

Next add the `+satellite-client-6-for-rhel-9+` repository.

[arabic]
. Paste the following into the search bar.

[source,bash]
----
satellite-client-6-for-rhel-9
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Click the `+++` symbol.

Next, we’ll navigate to the `+Products+` menu.

.products
image::../assets/products.png[products]

Click on `+Red Hat Enterprise Linux for x86_64+`.

.rhel product click
image::../assets/rhelproductclick.png[rhel product click]

Do the following to synchronize the repository with Satellite.

[arabic]
. Select `+Red Hat Satellite Client 6 for RHEL 9 x86_64 RPMs+`.
. Click `+Sync Now+`.

.sync
image::../assets/syncclientproduct.png[sync]

== Add the Satellite client repository to the RHEL9 content view

Now that the repository containing the Tracer application is
synchronized to Satellite, we’ll make it available to our hosts by
adding and enabling the repository in our existing `+RHEL9+` content
view.

Navigate to `+Content Views+`.

.cv
image::../assets/contentview.png[cv]

Click on the `+RHEL9+` content view.

.rhel9cv
image::../assets/rhel9cv.png[rhel9cv]

Click on the `+Repositories+` tab.

.repos
image::../assets/cvrepotab.png[repos]

Select `+All+` from the `+Status+` dropdown to unhide the Satellite
tools repository. image:../assets/unhide.png[unhide]

Add the repo.

[arabic]
. Select the repo `+Red Hat Satellite Client 6 for RHEL 9 x86_64 RPMs+`.
. Click `+Add repositories+`.

.add repos
image::../assets/addclientrepo.png[add repos]

Click `+Publish new version+`.

.pub
image::../assets/publishnewversion.png[pub]

We’ll now publish a new version of the content view.

[arabic]
. Add a description to the new version of the content view. In this
example we added `+Added the Satellite Client 6 repo.+`.
. Click `+Promote+`.
. Click on the `+Test+` lifecycle environment.
. Click `+Next+`.

.pubcv
image::../assets/publishclientrepocv.png[pubcv]

Click `+Finish+`.

.finish

== Enable access to the Satellite client repository

Now we’ll enable access to the
`+Red Hat Satellite Client 6 for RHEL 9 x86_64 RPMs+` repo by specifying
it in the `+Activation Key+`. When new hosts are added, they will
automatically receive access to the enabled repository so that Tracer
can be installed.

With existing hosts, there is one extra step which we’ll cover in this
challenge.

First, navigate to `+Activation Keys+`.

.activation keys
image::../assets/akmenu.png[activation keys]

Click on the `+RHEL9+` activation key.

.rhel9ak
image::../assets/rhel9ak.png[rhel9ak]

Click on `+Repository Sets+`.

.rhel9 ak repo set
image::../assets/rhel9akreposet.png[rhel9 ak repo set]

Override the `+Red Hat Satellite Client 6 for RHEL 9 x86_64 RPMs+`
repository to `+Enabled+`.

[arabic]
. Select the `+Red Hat Satellite Client 6 for RHEL 9 x86_64 RPMs+`
repository.
. Click `+Override to Enabled+`.

.override
image::../assets/overrideenable.png[override]

== Install Tracer on existing hosts managed by Satellite

Here’s the extra step we’ll need to perform to enable access to the
Tracer app for our existing hosts. New hosts added after this step will
automatically get access.

Go back to the `+All hosts+` menu.

.allhostsagain
image::../assets/allhostsagain.png[allhostsagain]

[arabic]
. Select your hosts (rhel1 and rhel2).
. Click `+Select Action+`.
. Select `+Schedule Remote Job+`.

.all host
image::../assets/scheduleremotejob.png[all host]

In the `+Category and Template+` menu, click `+Next+`.

.run template
image::../assets/runjobtemplate.png[run template]

In the `+Target hosts and inputs+` menu, do the following.

[arabic]
. Paste this command. It will enable the Satellite 6 client repo and
install the Tracer software.

[source,bash]
----
dnf config-manager --set-enabled satellite-client-6-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms && dnf install -y katello-host-tools-tracer
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Click `+Run on selected hosts+`.
image:../assets/runonselectedhosts.png[run on selected hosts]

Tracer is now installed. We’ll see how it will help us in the next
challenge, where we apply errata updates.
