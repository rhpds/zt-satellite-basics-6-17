== Install software

We’ll install software on multiple hosts simultaneously, using a Host
Collection.

A host collection is a group of content hosts. This feature enables you
to perform the same action on multiple hosts at once. These actions can
include the installation, removal, and update of packages and errata,
change of assigned life cycle environment, and change of Content View.
You can create host collections to suit your requirements, and those of
your company. For example, group hosts in host collections by function,
department, or business unit.

For more information on Host Collections, please see
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.15/html/managing_hosts/configuring_host_collections_managing-hosts[Configuring
Host Collections].

tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you switch easily between
several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the
background) and reattach them to a different terminal.
